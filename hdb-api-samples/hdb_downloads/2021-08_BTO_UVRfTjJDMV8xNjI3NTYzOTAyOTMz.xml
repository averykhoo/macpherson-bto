					This is an estimated date that the flat will be completed and ready for key collection, and the actual completion date will depend on the progress of construction works on site. As the Estimated Completion Date (ECD) is indicative only, HDB shall not be responsible for any damage or loss arising from a change in the ECD.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
					After booking the flat, buyers may check for updates via My HDBPage on HDB InfoWEB, as the construction of the project progresses.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
					Note: The contractual date in the Agreement for Lease by which HDB is required to deliver vacant possession of the booked flat to buyers is known as the Delivery Possession Date (DPD), which is 18 months after the ECD. Currently, the estimated DPD is 31 March 2029.

			Queen's Arc &lt;a class="audioBtn queens-arc">&lt;i class="fas fa-volume-up">&lt;/i>&lt;/a> is bounded by Queen's Crescent and Queensway Drive. You can choose from the 610 units of 3- and 4-room flats on offer, which will be housed in 2 residential blocks ranging from 23 to 39 storeys. Together with an additional residential block of rental flats, there will be 3 residential blocks in this development.
			&lt;br>&lt;br>
			The residential blocks at Queen's Arc will curve along a series of landscaped trails designed to promote wellness. Along these wellness trails, you will be able to find pavilions, fitness stations, and playgrounds. Complementing these trails is a heritage trail designed to bring residents through the history of Queensway.
			&lt;br>&lt;br>
			Queen's Arc will be served by a Multi-Storey Car Park, which will feature a garden on its roof, and a community hub on the ground floor. The roof garden will come with adult and elderly fitness stations and a jogging loop, while the community hub offers a variety of facilities such as a childcare centre, an eating house, a minimart, and other shops. Other facilities at Queen' Arc include roof gardens atop each of the 2 residential blocks, as well as a residentsâ€™ network centre. Please refer to the site plan for the facilities provided in this development. Facilities in this development will be accessible by the public.

                HDB precincts are planned to serve the evolving needs of the community. There are spaces catered for future inclusion of amenities/ facilities (such as childcare centres, elderly-related facilities, education centres, residents' network centres, and day activity centres), commercial facilities (such as shops and eating houses), mechanical and electrical rooms, and such other facilities depending on the prevailing needs. These spaces could be in the void decks, common property, car parks, or stand-alone community buildings.
