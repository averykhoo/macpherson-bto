            <tooltip>The 3-, 4-, and 5-room flats are sold on a 99-year lease. First-timer and second-timer families, and first-timer singles will be offered 99-year 2-room Flexi flats. Eligible Singapore Citizens and their spouses (if applicable) aged 55 and above can choose a short lease of between 15 and 45 years, in five-year increments, for the 2-room Flexi flat. The chosen lease has to cover them up to the age of at least 95 years.</tooltip>

                Estimated Waiting Time refers to the estimated length of time successful applicants have to wait for the delivery of their BTO project. It is computed from the median month of the flat selection period, which is between Aug 2023 and May 2024 for this May 2023 BTO launch, to the median of the projected completion month of the blocks within this project.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
Estimated Completion Date (ECD) is the estimated date that the project will be completed. As ECD will depend on the progress of construction works on site, HDB shall not be responsible for any damage or loss arising from a change in the ECD. The ECD of this project is 3Q 2027.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
Delivery Possession Date (DPD) is the contractual date in the Agreement for Lease by which HDB is required to deliver vacant possession of the booked flat to buyers. DPD is later than the ECD. The estimated DPD for this project is 31 Mar 2029.

                The indicative price range of the flats exclude grants and are based on 99-year leases.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
Actual prices may vary based on the actual attributes of the flats at the time of selection. Prices include the costs of floor finishes, internal doors, and sanitary fittings.

Plantation Verge &lt;a class="audioBtn Plantation-Verge">&lt;i class="fas fa-volume-up">&lt;/i>&lt;/a> is located in Tengah Plantation district and along Plantation Close. The project spans 7 residential blocks ranging from 14 to 18 storeys. There are a total of 971 units of 2-Flexi, 3-, 4-, and 5-room flats available.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
The name Plantation Verge references the project’s location along the Forest Fringe. The project features a central courtyard that offers various facilities for residents, including children's playgrounds, adult and elderly fitness corners, seats, and shelters where they can relax and interact. The Multi-Storey Car Park (MSCP) comes with a childcare centre on the second storey and a roof garden on the top floor. Please refer to the site plan located at the top of this page, for the facilities provided in Plantation Verge. Facilities in this project will be accessible by the public.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
&lt;u>About Plantation District&lt;/u>
&lt;br>&lt;br>
Inspired by the villages and farms that once dotted Tengah in the 1950s, Plantation District will be the home of community farming. The Plantation Farmway will run through the precincts, and spaces will be set aside for residents to enjoy community gardening and urban farming in their own neighbourhood. Key amenities such as a Community Club, Neighbourhood Centre, and a shopping street will line the Plantation Farmway, making it a vibrant spot for residents to gather.
&lt;br>&lt;br>

        </overview>
        <notes>
            <p>
                HDB precincts are planned to serve the evolving needs of the community. There are spaces catered for future inclusion of amenities/ facilities (such as childcare centres, eldercare facilities, education centres, residents' network centres, day activity centres, etc), commercial facilities (such as shops and eating houses), mechanical and electrical rooms, and such other facilities depending on the prevailing needs. These spaces could be in the void decks, common property, car parks, or stand-alone community buildings.
&lt;br>&lt;br>In addition, housing projects may be located near roads, railways, airbases, and land used for non-residential purposes. Hence, residents may experience higher noise levels. We have provided information on the surrounding land use, proposed facilities and their locations in the maps and plans of individual projects, where feasible. The information provided is indicatively based on the current planning intent of the relevant authorities and is subject to change from time to time.

&lt;p>As announced by LTA and HDB on 5 Oct 2022, there will be designated HDB car-lite precincts within gazetted car-lite areas. They are planned with good public transport, walking, and cycling connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plantation Verge is designated as an HDB car-lite precinct within the Tengah car-lite area. Designed for residents to adopt green modes of commuting, the parking provision will be reduced, freeing up space for public facilities and greenery. With more limited parking provision, available lots will be prioritised for residents in these precincts through additional parking demand management measures:&lt;/p>        
&lt;ul>
  &lt;li>&lt;b>Season parking will be reduced and restricted to residents only&lt;/b>. Similar to all other HDB residential carparks, season parking sales will be on a first-come-first-served basis, subject to availability, and residents’ first car will be accorded higher priority than residents' 2nd and subsequent car(s). As non-residents will not be able to buy season parking within car-lite precincts, they may do so at alternative nearby car parks.&lt;/li>
  &lt;br />
  &lt;li>&lt;b>Residents who buy season parking for their 2nd and subsequent vehicles will be charged a higher season parking rate&lt;/b> pegged to Tier 2 Restricted Zone rate, subject to availability. Learn more about the &lt;a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/car-parks/season-parking/season-parking/application-procedure">tiers for monthly season parking charges&lt;/a> and the current rates.&lt;/li>
  &lt;br />
  &lt;li>&lt;b>Short-term parking for visitors will remain available, albeit with limited lots&lt;/b>. Parking charges may be adjusted based on demand.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

                &lt;p>Residents can choose to subscribe to have air conditioning provided from a centralised cooling system. This system for public housing is the first of its kind in Singapore. &lt;/p>&lt;p>Cooling to each household unit will come from highly energy efficient chillers, and residents need not install nor maintain outdoor condensing units on their air-conditioner ledge. They will get to enjoy cost savings while contributing to a sustainable lifestyle in this eco-friendly district. Residents may decide to subscribe to the centralised cooling system after signing the Agreement for Lease. &lt;/p>

                Homes in Tengah town will be surrounded by lush greenery and nature. HDB has applied its Biophilic Town Framework to guide the enhancement of existing natural assets and the design and development of neighbourhood landscapes in Tengah. Residents can look forward to nature-centric neighbourhoods that offer a greater sense of place, better well-being, and an enhanced quality of life. A variety of outdoor spaces and landscape features will be introduced to draw people closer to nature. A town-wide Active, Beautiful, and Clean Waters design strategy will also be introduced to slow down and treat stormwater runoff, while enhancing the biodiversity. Find out more details on &lt;a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/history/hdb-towns-your-home/tengah">Tengah town&lt;/a>.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
Tengah will be the first town to integrate housing projects with the area’s surrounding greenery and biodiversity. One major attraction will be the approximately 100-metre wide and 5km long Forest Corridor, which will form part of the larger network of greenery that connects the Western Water Catchment Area and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. In collaboration with the National Parks Boards, various tree species will be planted in the Forest Corridor to transform it into a rich forest habitat.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
Complementing the Forest Corridor is the Forest Fringe, a 15- to 20-metre wide linear greenscape that will provide a tranquil and rustic environment for residents to enjoy flora and fauna. In addition, extensive park spaces, such as the Central Park and Community Farmways, will string key amenities and facilities together, providing a safe environment for residents to access their daily amenities.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
Tengah will be the first HDB town to have a car-free town centre nestled next to a lush green park. To encourage green commuting, there will be dedicated walking and cycling paths along all roads to create seamless connections within the town. The upcoming Jurong Region Line and bus services will serve the public transport needs of residents.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
Tengah is also the first HDB town to be planned with town-wide smart technologies from the outset. Guided by HDB’s Smart Town Framework, the various districts will integrate smart technology in its design, so that residents can enjoy a quality living environment. Autonomous vehicles will be piloted in Tengah town to provide convenient first-mile-last-mile connection to key transport nodes and amenities.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
Apart from existing primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions in the vicinity of Tengah town, new schools will also be built within the town. This includes Anglo Chinese School (Primary), which will be situated within 1km of Parc Meadow @ Tengah when it relocates to the town in 2030.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
Vibrant commercial facilities are planned for the town centre and in the districts, complementing other shopping and dining options in the nearby Bukit Batok town. Check out the heartland shops on &lt;a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/where2shop/explore/bukit-batok">Where2Shop@HDB&lt;/a>.
