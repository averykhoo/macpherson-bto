                This is an estimated date that the flat will be completed and ready for key collection, and the actual completion date will depend on the progress of construction works on site. As the Estimated Completion Date (ECD) is indicative only, HDB shall not be responsible for any damage or loss arising from a change in the ECD.
&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
After booking the flat, buyers may check for updates via My HDBPage on HDB InfoWEB, as the construction of the project progresses.
&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
Note: The contractual date in the Agreement for Lease by which HDB is required to deliver vacant possession of the booked flat to buyers is known as the Delivery Possession Date (DPD), which may vary from project to project. Currently, the estimated DPD is from 30 Sep 2029.

&lt;br>&lt;br>
Ghim Moh Ascent is located within the Health District @ Queenstown. Residents of Ghim Moh Ascent will be able to access a range of initiatives that will be implemented to enhance their physical, social, and mental well-being. For example, Ghim Moh Ascent will feature a range of recreational facilities closely located to one another to foster family and inter-generational bonding.

The roof gardens on the 9th storey of some residential blocks and atop the MSCP also make for ideal spots for residents to interact with one another, or to unwind and relax. Additionally, Ghim Moh Ascent has been planned with good connectivity to the Rail Corridor and the Ulu Pandan Canal and Park Connector, where residents can be closer to nature and enjoy a variety of activities to boost their health.

            <p>
                HDB precincts are planned to serve the evolving needs of the community. There are spaces catered for future inclusion of amenities/ facilities (such as childcare centres, elderly-related facilities, education centres, residents' network centres, day activity centres, etc), commercial facilities (such as shops and eating houses), mechanical and electrical rooms, and such other facilities depending on the prevailing needs. These spaces could be in the void decks, common property, car parks, or stand-alone community buildings.
&lt;br>&lt;br>In addition, housing projects may be located near roads, railways, airbases, and land used for non-residential purposes. Hence, residents may experience higher noise levels. We have provided information on the surrounding land use, proposed facilities and their locations in the maps and plans of individual projects, where feasible. The information provided is indicatively based on the current planning intent of the relevant authorities and is subject to change from time to time.
