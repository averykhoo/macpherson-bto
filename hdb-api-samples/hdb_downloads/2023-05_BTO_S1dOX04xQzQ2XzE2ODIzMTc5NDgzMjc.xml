                Estimated Waiting Time refers to the estimated length of time successful applicants have to wait for the delivery of their BTO project. It is computed from the median month of the flat selection period, which is between Aug 2023 and May 2024 for this May 2023 BTO launch, to the median of the projected completion month of the blocks within this project.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
Estimated Completion Date (ECD) is the estimated date that the project will be completed. As ECD will depend on the progress of construction works on site, HDB shall not be responsible for any damage or loss arising from a change in the ECD. The ECD of this project is 4Q 2027.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
Delivery Possession Date (DPD) is the contractual date in the Agreement for Lease by which HDB is required to deliver vacant possession of the booked flat to buyers. DPD is later than the ECD. The estimated DPD for this project is 30 Jun 2029.

                The indicative price range of the flats exclude grants and are based on 99-year leases.

Actual prices may vary based on the actual attributes of the flats at the time of selection. Find out details of the Optional Component Scheme offered for this project.

Farrer Park Arena &lt;a class="audioBtn Farrer-Park-Arena">&lt;i class="fas fa-volume-up">&lt;/i>&lt;/a> is bounded by Farrer Park Road and Dorset Road. The project is offered under the &lt;a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/finding-a-flat/plh">Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model&lt;/a>, and comprises 3 residential blocks, each with 24 storeys. You can choose from 569 units of 3- and 4-room flats.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
The name Farrer Park Arena takes inspiration from the past, as the project site used to house a boxing gym. The former boxing gym building will be repurposed into a multi-purpose community sporting space to honour its unique heritage. In addition, you can also jog amid the green surrounds of Farrer Park Arena and work out at the adult and elderly fitness stations. Those who enjoy ball games will enjoy the hard court located at the roof garden above the Multi-Storey Car Park. Other facilities within the project include children’s playgrounds, a childcare centre, and a residents’ network centre.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
Residents can also enjoy more facilities located just next door, such as a proposed park and new sports centre, which will boast swimming pools, a field, as well as other sporting facilities.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
Please refer to the site plan located at the top of this page for the facilities provided in the project. Facilities in this project will be accessible by the public.
&lt;br>&lt;br>

        <notes>
            <p>
                HDB precincts are planned to serve the evolving needs of the community. There are spaces catered for future inclusion of amenities/ facilities (such as childcare centres, eldercare facilities, education centres, residents' network centres, day activity centres, etc), commercial facilities (such as shops and eating houses), mechanical and electrical rooms, and such other facilities depending on the prevailing needs. These spaces could be in the void decks, common property, car parks, or stand-alone community buildings.
&lt;br>&lt;br>In addition, housing projects may be located near roads, railways, airbases, and land used for non-residential purposes. Hence, residents may experience higher noise levels. We have provided information on the surrounding land use, proposed facilities and their locations in the maps and plans of individual projects, where feasible. The information provided is indicatively based on the current planning intent of the relevant authorities and is subject to change from time to time.
