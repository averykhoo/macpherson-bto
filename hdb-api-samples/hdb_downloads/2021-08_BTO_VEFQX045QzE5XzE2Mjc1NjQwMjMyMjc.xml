					This is an estimated date that the flat will be completed and ready for key collection, and the actual completion date will depend on the progress of construction works on site. As the Estimated Completion Date (ECD) is indicative only, HDB shall not be responsible for any damage or loss arising from a change in the ECD.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
					After booking the flat, buyers may check for updates via My HDBPage on HDB InfoWEB, as the construction of the project progresses.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
					Note: The contractual date in the Agreement for Lease by which HDB is required to deliver vacant possession of the booked flat to buyers is known as the Delivery Possession Date (DPD), which is 18 months after the ECD. Currently, the estimated DPD is 31 March 2027.
